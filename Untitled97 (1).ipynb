            "Okay, here's a comprehensive risk management plan based on the provided forex trading recommendations and the PNP strategy rules. This plan prioritizes capital preservation and consistent profitability over aggressive gains.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Forex Trading Risk Management Plan**\n",
            "\n",
            "**I. General Principles**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Capital Preservation:** The primary goal is to protect trading capital. Risk management rules will be strictly adhered to.\n",
            "*   **Discipline:**  All trades must align with the PNP strategy rules and the risk management plan.  Emotional decision-making is strictly prohibited.\n",
            "*   **Adaptability:** The forex market is dynamic. This plan will be reviewed and adjusted as necessary, based on market conditions and performance.\n",
            "*   **Documentation:**  All trades will be documented, including entry reasons, trade management decisions, and outcomes. This data will be used for performance analysis and strategy refinement.\n",
            "\n",
            "**II. Portfolio Risk Management**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Maximum Portfolio Risk Percentage:**\n",
            "    *   **2% of Total Trading Capital at Risk per Trade, Max 3 Trades Open At The Same Time.** This means the total amount risked across ALL open positions cannot exceed 2% of your total trading capital.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Maximum Correlated Exposure:**\n",
            "    *   **3% of Total Capital in Correlated Pairs.**  Correlation refers to how closely pairs move in the same or opposite directions.  For example, EURUSD and GBPUSD are often positively correlated. Since the recommended trades involve selling both EURUSD and GBPUSD, their combined risk exposure cannot exceed 3% of total capital. If you take one of the trades that utilizes the full 2%, then the maximum risk you can utilize on the other trade is 1% .\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Account Segregation:**\n",
            "    *   **Dedicated Trading Account:** Use a dedicated trading account solely for forex trading to avoid commingling funds.\n",
            "    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Monitor account balances and margin levels daily.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "2.  **Pip Value:**  Pip value depends on the currency pair and lot size. Obtain this information from your broker.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Conservative vs. Aggressive:** The recommendations offer both conservative and aggressive entries and stop losses. Choose *one* approach and stick to it consistently. Conservative is generally recommended for beginners.\n",

            "4.  **Position Sizing Examples (Assuming a $10,000 Account):**\n",

            "    *   **AUDUSD:** 0.631\n",
            "    *   **Adherence to PNP Strategy:** Ensure the stop loss meets the PNP strategy requirements.  Specifically, ensure the risk-reward ratio is at least 1:1.5 *before* entering the trade. And that the candle is not bigger than 0.25% before entering.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Adjusting Stop Losses (Trailing Stop):**\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **Move to Breakeven:** Once the price moves in your favor by an amount equal to the initial risk (e.g., if the initial risk was 100 pips, move the stop loss to breakeven after a 100-pip profit), move the stop loss to your entry point.\n",
            "    *   **Trailing Stop Based on Price Action:** As the price moves further in your favor, trail the stop loss based on significant support/resistance levels (for long positions, trail below significant support; for short positions, trail above significant resistance).\n",
            "    *   **EMA-Based Trailing Stop:**  Consider using a trailing stop based on the 200 EMA on a higher timeframe (e.g., 1-hour chart) to capture longer-term trends. Trail the stop loss just below the EMA for long positions, and just above the EMA for short positions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Do Not Widen Stop Losses:** Under no circumstances should you widen your stop loss after entering a trade.\n",

            "**V. Profit Taking**\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "    *   **At TP1 (50%):** Close 50% of the position when the price reaches TP1. This secures some profit and reduces overall risk.\n",
            "        *   **USDJPY:** 146.18 (Conservative & Aggressive)\n",

            "\n",
            "    *   **Risk Free TP1 - EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD (50%)**: If your risk reward is above 1:2.0, close 50% of the position once you hit a 1:1 ratio.\n",

            "2.  **Alternative Profit Taking (If no defined TP1/TP2):**\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **Risk-Reward Ratio Target:** Aim for at least a 1:2 risk-reward ratio. If a clear price action level doesn't exist near TP2, aim for TP2. If there is price action at 1:1.5, aim for 1:1.5\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Manual Closure:**  Be prepared to manually close positions if market conditions change rapidly or if the trade no longer aligns with the PNP strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "**VI. Exit Strategy**\n",

            "3.  **Violation of PNP Strategy:**\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   If the trade setup invalidates (e.g., the 200 EMA on the 5-minute chart crosses the price in the opposite direction of your trade *after* you've entered), close the position.\n",
            "    *   If new, adverse economic data is released that significantly impacts the currency pair, close the position.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Time-Based Exit:**  If a trade is not progressing after a pre-determined period (e.g., 48 hours), consider closing it.  Stagnant trades can tie up capital. This should only be considered if the trade is still trending towards the target and has not shown any indication of going against the plan.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Weekend Risk:** Close all positions before the weekend to avoid potential gap risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "**VII. Loss Limits and Trading Pause**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Daily Loss Limit:** 3% of the Trading Account. If you lose 3% of your account balance in a single day, stop trading for the remainder of the day.\n",
            "2.  **Weekly Loss Limit:** 5% of the Trading Account. If you lose 5% of your account balance in a single week, stop trading for the remainder of the week.\n",
            "3.  **Monthly Loss Limit:** 8% of the Trading Account. If you lose 8% of your account balance in a single month, stop trading and re-evaluate your strategy.\n",
            "4.  **Mandatory Review:** After hitting a daily/weekly/monthly loss limit, conduct a thorough review of your trading performance to identify the reasons for the losses and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n",
            "\n",
            "**VIII. Scaling In/Out of Positions**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Scaling In (Generally Discouraged):** Scaling into losing positions is prohibited.\n",
            "2.  **Scaling Out (Encouraged):** Implement partial profit-taking as described in the \"Profit Taking\" section. Do not scale in until you hit TP1 (or other risk reduction metric).\n",
            "3.  **Only scale in with a second position if:** the trend is confirmed to be intact.\n",
            "\n",
            "**IX. PNP Strategy Specific Rules Implementation**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Timeframe Confluence:** Strictly adhere to using the 200 EMA on both the 5-minute and 15-minute timeframes as outlined in the PNP strategy.\n",
            "2.  **Pattern Recognition:**  Only enter trades based on confirmed Double Tops/Bottoms or Head & Shoulders/Inverted HNS patterns that meet the PNP criteria (V-shape in the center of double tops/bottoms, DCC confirmation for Head & Shoulders).\n",
            "3.  **Entry Timing:**  Only enter trades between 10 AM and 10 PM (your local time zone).\n",
            "4.  **200 EMA Proximity:**  Strictly avoid trades where the 200 EMA on the 5-minute or 15-minute timeframe is near the entry point, resulting in a risk-reward ratio below 1:1.5.\n",
            "5.  **Risk-Reward Ratio:**  Always aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:1.5. The maximum stop loss should be 0.30% of the account balance.\n",
            "6.  **EMA Pattern Formation:** Ensure Double Tops/Bottoms and Head & Shoulders patterns form *on* the EMA.\n",
            "7.  **Entry Candle Size:** Avoid entering trades if the entry candle is larger than 0.25%.\n",
            "8.  **Shoulder Candle Count:**  Ensure there are at least 7-8 candles in both shoulders of a Head & Shoulders/Inverted HNS pattern.\n",
            "9.  **Target Proximity:** Avoid entry if the recent high or low is within 50% of the overall target.\n",
            "\n",
            "**X. Ongoing Monitoring and Review**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Daily Review:** Review all open positions and recent trades to ensure they still align with the PNP strategy and the risk management plan.\n",
            "2.  **Weekly Review:** Analyze trading performance, identify areas for improvement, and adjust the strategy and risk management plan as needed.\n",
            "3.  **Monthly Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of trading performance, including win rate, risk-reward ratio, and overall profitability. Make adjustments to the strategy and risk management plan based on the results of the review. Backtest PNP on similar pairs.\n",
            "4.  **Stay Informed:** Stay up-to-date on economic news and events that could impact the forex market. Adjust your trading strategy accordingly.\n",
            "5.  **Adaptability:** The market is constantly changing. The plan must be able to adapt as market sentiment and indicators are known to change.\n",
